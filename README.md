If you are on Mac, then we need to run the code itself. The following dependencies are required before the code can be run: 

* Operating System: Mac
* Python version 3.9
* Create a new virtual environment using “python3 -m venv group4_env”
* Then run the virtual environment using “source group4_env/bin/activate”
